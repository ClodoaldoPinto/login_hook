  <h1>The login_hook database extension</h1>
  <p>The login_hook extension provides a way to execute some code at client
    login.</p>
  <p>The login_hook extension consists of a shared library login_hook.so and
    schema login_hook with function login() returns void.</p>
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>First you'll need to compile the database extension. Please check the
    Postgres manual for that.</p>
  <p>After compilation, the login_hook.so library must be set to load at
    session start. So please alter the postgresql.conf file and add the
    login_hook.so library to the session_preload_libraries setting. For example:</p>
  <table class="example">
    <tr>
      <td><pre>      .
      .
      .

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CUSTOMIZED OPTIONS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add settings for extensions here
#
session_preload_libraries = 'login_hook.so'</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Restart the database to activate the setting</p>
  <p>Then execute</p>
  <table class="example">
    <tr>
      <td><pre>create extension login_hook;</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>in the database in which you want the login function to be executed
    when a client logs in.</p>
  <p>And then override the login_hook.login() function to make it work for you.
    The one that is defined in the database extension is not very useful. You
    can use any programming language that is supported by your database a long
    as you stick to the signature (named login_hook.login, no arguments,
    returning void). Example:</p>
  <table class="example">
    <tr>
      <td><pre>
create or replace function login_hook.login()
                           returns void
                           security definer
                           language plpgsql
                           as
$$
declare
    &lt; ... whatever you need ... &gt;
begin
    &lt; ... do something useful ... &gt;
end
$$;</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Be aware of the fact that the login_hook.login() will be executed as
    part of process start. The process is not fully initialized yet. For example
    the system catalog (the pg_catalog schema) may not yet be fully operational.
    But most actions can be performed.</p>
  <p>The login_hook.login() function will only be executed in a database
    that has the login_hook database extension installed (or more precise: if a
    database contains schema 'login_hook', then the existence of function
    login_hook.login() is taken for granted and invocation s attempted). If a
    database does not have a login_hook schema, no attempt is made to invoke the
    function.</p>
